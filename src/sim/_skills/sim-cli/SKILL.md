name: sim-cli
description: Cross-solver operating discipline for sim-cli workflows — tool choice, input classification, acceptance semantics, and escalation rules that apply across solvers. Use alongside the solver's own plugin skill, which is self-contained for solver-specific work; this skill carries only the shared rules.

# sim-cli

You are working in a **sim-cli**-enabled solver workflow. Use the `sim`
runtime where it adds control and observability, and compose solver-native
tools directly where they are the right primitive. This skill carries the
**cross-solver discipline** — the rules that hold across sim-cli workflows,
regardless of which solver you drive.

The solver's **plugin skill** is self-contained for solver-specific work:
solver hard constraints, dependency chains, snippets, workflows, SDK/solver
notes. It does not depend on loading this skill — but it should stay
consistent with the discipline below. If a rule applies to more than one
solver, it belongs here, not in a plugin skill.

---

## Execution models

The plugin skill tells you which model the solver uses. Choose the narrowest
correct execution primitive; sim-cli is composable, not a universal wrapper.

| Model | Used by | Lifecycle |
|---|---|---|
| **Persistent session** | Drivers that hold a live process open | `sim connect → sim exec × N → sim inspect → sim disconnect` |
| **sim-wrapped one-shot batch** | Plugin wrappers that add linting, profile-aware invocation, parsing, history, or safer execution | `sim check → sim run → parse_output/logs → evaluate` |
| **Native/tool one-shot batch** | Ready solver decks/scripts, vendor batch commands, project pipelines, or post-processing tools where native execution is the right primitive | version/profile probe → native command/script → parse artifacts/logs → evaluate |

sim-cli does **not** try to wrap every solver operation, executable flag,
vendor batch mode, or post-processing script. Use `sim` when it adds a stable
control plane: solver discovery and profile checks, live sessions, bounded
`exec` / `inspect` loops, history/log capture, parsing, screenshots, or shared
agent discipline. If the artifact is already a solver-native deck/script and
the solver's own batch command is the right execution primitive, call that
native command directly instead of forcing it through `sim run`. Preserve
stdout/stderr, generated files, and acceptance evidence just as carefully.

Use `sim run` when the plugin skill says it is the canonical one-shot path or
when the wrapper adds real value. Otherwise, keep the sim-cli discipline while
composing the solver's native tools directly.

**The loop, any model:** classify inputs and get the missing Category A values
from the user (including the acceptance criterion) → choose the execution
primitive → run a Step-0 version/profile probe (`sim inspect session.versions`
for persistent sessions; `sim check <solver>`, plugin guidance, or native
`--version` / license probe for one-shot work) → execute one bounded step at a
time → inspect `last.result` or parse the native logs/artifacts between steps →
evaluate against the acceptance criterion → `sim disconnect` if a persistent
session was opened. On any failure, stop and report — do not silently retry.

---

## Hard constraints (shared sim-cli discipline)

1. **Never invent Category A defaults.** Physical decisions — geometry,
   materials, boundary conditions, the acceptance criterion — must come from
   the user. "Just use defaults" / "just run it" does not override this;
   treat it as a missing input and ask.
2. **Step-0 version/profile probe is mandatory.** After `sim connect`, call
   `sim inspect session.versions` and use the returned `profile` /
   `active_sdk_layer` / `active_solver_layer` to pick the right files in the
   plugin skill. Treat `solver_version` as active-runtime evidence only when
   `version_source` is `active_runtime`; a detected installation is not proof
   that the same version was launched. If the runtime version is unreported or
   has no compatible profile, stop before applying version-specific guidance.
   Before `sim run` or native one-shot execution, run the
   relevant probe for that path (`sim check <solver>`, plugin guidance, or the
   solver's native `--version` / license check). If a required profile is empty,
   unknown, or deprecated — **stop**.
3. **Acceptance ≠ exit code.** A `sim run` / `sim exec` / native solver command
   can return success and still be physically wrong. Always validate against an
   outcome-based, bounded, measurable criterion — not "the solver ran".
4. **Never silently retry a failed step.** Report `stderr`, `stdout`, and
   `run_count` / completion state / relevant artifact state; let the user
   decide the next move.
5. **Reference example values are not defaults.** Values in any `examples/`
   directory describe a specific published test case. Offer them explicitly
   if useful, but wait for the user's confirmation before adopting them.

## Input classification

Every task starts with: which inputs must the user supply, which may I
default, which can I derive from the files in front of me?

| Category | Rule | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **A — physical decisions** | **Must ask if absent.** Non-negotiable. | Geometry, materials, boundary/initial conditions, physics-model choices, the acceptance criterion |
| **B — operational** | **May default — must disclose.** Affects runtime/convenience, not what the simulation represents. | `--processors`, `--ui-mode`, `--workspace`, smoke-test iteration counts, log verbosity |
| **C — file-derivable** | **Infer from the actual files** via a diagnostic `sim exec`, solver-native inspection command, or artifact parser — not from a similar example. Confirm if a downstream decision depends on it. | Mesh cell count, boundary names/types, fields present in a result file, material IDs |

Do not start until every Category A field has an explicit value from the user.

## First causal failure gate

When a workflow fails, locate the first failed stage before changing the model:
environment/license -> launch or attach -> file import -> model setup -> mesh or
build -> solve -> postprocess/export. Preserve the first new error, the exact
entrypoint, active version/profile, and relevant artifact identity; later errors
may only be consequences.

Run the smallest stage-specific probe that can confirm or reject one cause.
Do not change physics, boundary conditions, mesh controls, or solver settings to
work around an unproven environment, import, or setup failure. Retry only after
naming the hypothesis and the evidence expected to change.

## Where `sim serve` runs (Windows session-context foot-gun)

If you reach a remote `sim` host via `sim --host <host>` or `SIM_HOST`, **how
the operator started `sim serve` changes which drivers actually work.** This
is purely a Windows concern — Linux and macOS don't isolate display sessions
the same way.

| `sim serve` started from… | Headless / CLI drivers | GUI-capable drivers |
|---|---|---|
| Logged-in Windows desktop (Windows Terminal / RDP / Task Scheduler "run only when user is logged on" + interactive) | ✅ works | ✅ works — windows are visible; `gui` can find / click / screenshot them |
| SSH session (`ssh <host>` then `sim serve …`) | ✅ works | ❌ silent breakage — windows launch in a non-interactive session with no display surface; `gui` finds zero windows, screenshots come back black |

If the host advertises `tools: ["gui"]` but `gui.find(...)` returns nothing
for windows you have strong reason to believe exist, **do not retry** —
surface "the server may have been started from a non-interactive session" and
ask the operator to restart `sim serve` from a desktop session. The agent
never starts `sim serve` itself.

See [`gui/SKILL.md`](gui/SKILL.md) for the full GUI actuation API.

## Long-running and multi-stage workflows

Do not wait for or request a dedicated per-task primitive (a resumable-sweep
API, an auto-coupling feature, etc.) when the generic primitives already
suffice. Bounded `exec`/`run` calls, `session.health` / solve-progress
inspection, and the solver's own retained project/session state are enough to
drive a long sweep, a multi-stage build, or a staged multi-physics coupling
yourself, one bounded step at a time. Reach for a new dedicated primitive only
when a real session hits a generic gap (no timeout guard, no liveness check,
no process cleanup) — not to shortcut a specific workflow that a generic loop
already covers.
